          We've all heard about MUNs— they’re a buzz of diplomacy and intellect
          that captivates the minds of students worldwide. But what truly lies
          behind this acronym?
          <br />
          <br />
          Model United Nations is a simulation of the actual United Nations
          conferences, where students work together to solve the world's biggest
          problems: war crimes, poverty, climate change, public health,
          terrorism, and more.
          <br />
          <br /> Within its confines, students embrace the roles of delegates,
          speakers, and chairs, transcending geographical boundaries to
          represent diverse nations and perspectives. In this dynamic setting,
          students from varied backgrounds converge, learn to negotiate with
          others of differing opinions and collaborate with like-minded
          representatives. <br />
          <br />
          MUN allows all participants to apply theoretical knowledge of
          international relations and of the United Nations system in a
          practical, hands-on setting. It nudges them to be actively involved in
          global issues; and enhances their understanding of the structure of
          the international system and challenges of global diplomacy.
          <br />
          <br /> Welcome to the first ever MUN at BML Munjal University, where
          delegates from across India are provided with the opportunity to
          engage in spirited debates, negotiate resolutions, and seek common
          ground amidst diverse perspectives. As we embark on this MUN journey,
          let us embrace the spirit of diplomacy, cooperation, and mutual
          respect. Let us remember that while our nations may differ, our
          humanity unites us.
          <br />
          <br /> With that, I declare the BML Munjal Model United Nations
          Conference officially open! May your deliberations be fruitful, your
          resolutions impactful, and your bonds enduring. Thank you.
